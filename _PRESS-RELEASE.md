There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
Mass-Edit
## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
An editor for the world.
## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
A text editor that everyone can view and take part in. A developer can fork an open source Github repo and then open up the source code on Mass-Edit and get working. Mass-Edit will notify that developer's followers via email and their followers can join in and code along as well. Its a great way for developers to take part in the development process of open source work and learn how to take part in projects.
## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
Working on open source projects can be difficult if you don't understand the mindset of the people working on them. Mass-Edit will allow users of Github to see their favorite developers working on open source projects  when they are online.
## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
Mass edit allows for people from all around the world take part in open source projects and actively see what is goin on.
## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
A great way to get involved in open source project and connect with your favorite developers.
## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
Just go to mass-edit, authorize it on your Github account and see if your favorite developers are working on anything at the moment!
## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
I really like how I can see how professional developers work and interact with them! It has really made be a better developer!
## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
Just go to massedit.com, give authorization to Mass-Edit to access your Github and give it a try!
